Includes GitHub/Slack-style colon codes such as `:slight_smile:` where relevant.

Includes emoji aliases from [muan/emojilib](https://github.com/muan/emojilib), so you can e.g. search for "mind blown" to find ü§Ø ‚ÄúExploding Head‚Äù.

Right after publishing this, I stumbled across [alfred-emoji](https://github.com/jsumners/alfred-emoji), which you might like to try instead!

Unlike my workflow, this workflow automatically keeps itself up-to-date.

It uses a Node script‚Äîso filtering is slightly slower!
It does bundle Node, so you don't have to install anything. However, that makes the download 19M instead of 4M ;-)
